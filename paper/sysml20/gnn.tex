%%%%%%%% SysML 2019 EXAMPLE LATEX SUBMISSION FILE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\documentclass{article}

% Recommended, but optional, packages for figures and better typesetting:
\usepackage{microtype}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{subfigure}
\usepackage{booktabs} % for professional tables
\usepackage{xspace}
\usepackage{amssymb}

% hyperref makes hyperlinks in the resulting PDF.
% If your build breaks (sometimes temporarily if a hyperlink spans a page)
% please comment out the following usepackage line and replace
% \usepackage{sysml2019} with \usepackage[nohyperref]{sysml2019} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}

% Attempt to make hyperref and algorithmic work together better:
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}
\newcommand{\Sys}{LuxGNN\xspace}
\newcommand{\ZJ}[1] {\textcolor{blue}{[ZJ: #1]}}

% Use the following line for the initial blind version submitted for review:
%\usepackage{sysml2019}

% If accepted, instead use the following line for the camera-ready submission:
\usepackage{sysml2019}

% The \sysmltitle you define below is probably too long as a header.
% Therefore, a short form for the running title is supplied here:
\sysmltitlerunning{A Distributed System for Large-Scale Graph Neural Networks}

\begin{document}

\twocolumn[
\sysmltitle{A Distributed System for Large-Scale Graph Neural Networks}

% It is OKAY to include author information, even for blind
% submissions: the style file will automatically remove it for you
% unless you've provided the [accepted] option to the sysml2019
% package.

% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

\begin{sysmlauthorlist}
\sysmlauthor{xxx}{to}
\end{sysmlauthorlist}

\sysmlaffiliation{to}{xxx}

\sysmlcorrespondingauthor{xxx}{c.vvvvv@googol.com}

% You may provide any keywords that you
% find helpful for describing your paper; these are used to populate
% the "keywords" metadata in the PDF but will not be shown in the document
\sysmlkeywords{Graph Neural Network, Distributed Framework}

% This command actually creates the footnote in the first column
% listing the affiliations and the copyright notice.
% The command takes one argument, which is text to display at the start of the footnote.
% The \sysmlEqualContribution command is standard text for equal contribution.
% Remove it (just {}) if you do not need this facility.

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018. It was modified from a version from Dan Roy in
% 2017, which was based on a version from Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
